Exercise 2:

Sample 1: 91.7% of peaks retained
Sample 2: 97.7% of peaks retained


Exercise 3:

Because a protein may not bind at the exact locus each time, there will be some variation in the peak range between the two samples. So, while outskirts of these p-value peaks, which would have lower p-values, may not be consistently reproducible, the center of these peaks with the highest values are much more likely to be reproducible and significant. Similarly to the outskirt values on large peaks, smaller p-value peaks may not be reproducible. Because we've normalized reads to the reads in the control dataset, we can infer there's significance in these p-values.
