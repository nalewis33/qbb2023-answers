Exercise 1.1

1 Mbp * 3x Coverage = 3 Mbp

3 Mbp = 3,000,000 bp 

3000000 bp /100 bp/read = 30,000 reads


Exercise 1.3

1. About 50,000 bp, or roughly 5%, of the genome has not been sequenced at 3X coverage. 

2. This coverage better matches the coverage of the Poisson distribution as opposed to the normal distrubution. The coverage histogram is shifted leftward compared to the normal distribition, which more closesly aligns with the Poisson distribution. 

Exercise 1.4

1. In this simulation, there are less than 100 bp that have not been sequence at 10X coverage, or less than one hundreth of a percent of the total genome. 

2. At 10X coverage, the Poisson distribution matches the coverage of the reads well. In addition, unlike at 3X coverage where the histogram was shifted left relative to normal distribution, the normal distribution at 10X aligns well. 

Exercise 1.5

1. At 30X coverage, almost the entire genome is sequenced, with fewer than 10 bp (less than a thousandth of a percent) being missed.

2. At 30X coverage, both the Poisson distribution and normal distribution overlay the histogram of coverage nearly perfectly. At this level of coverage, the two distributions are near identical, as the Poisson distribution approaches the normal distribution as the coverage increases.
